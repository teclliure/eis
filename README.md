Easy Invoice System (EIS)
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/teclliure/eis.png)](https://travis-ci.org/teclliure/eis)

Easy Invoice System (EIS) is a Symfony2 based easy to use invoice system.
Application is actually in early development phase.

The original idea is to build an easy to use/flexible invoice application
using Symfony2. I've used [Siwapp](http://www.siwapp.org/) but actually
it seems abandoned (at least PHP-Symfony version). This application will
provide a migration path from Siwapp.
